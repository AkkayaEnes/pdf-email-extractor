In this project, we used the Java programming language and PDFBox library to extract emails from a PDF file and write them to a text file.

We added the PDFBox library to the project using IntelliJ IDEA. This library is used to read and process PDF files. In IntelliJ IDEA, we added the PDFBox library to the project using Maven. Alternatively, the PDFBox library can be added manually to the project. To do this, we downloaded the "pdfbox-app-{version}.jar" file from the PDFBox website and copied it to the "lib" folder of the IntelliJ IDEA project.

The objective of the project was to automatically extract emails from PDF files and assist users in saving these emails in their desired format.

The project reads PDF files using the Apache PDFBox library and finds emails in the document using regular expressions. Finally, the project writes the extracted emails to a text file using the FileWriter class.

The source code of this project can be found on GitHub and is shared as an open-source project. Other developers can review the project and develop different methods for extracting emails from PDF files, thus contributing to the development of the project.
